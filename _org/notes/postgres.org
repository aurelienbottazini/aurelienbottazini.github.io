* Resetting a database

  More like resetting the public schema, but this is what I want most
  of the time.

#+begin_src sql
  DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE;
  CREATE SCHEMA public;
  GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO postgres;
  GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO public;
  COMMENT ON SCHEMA public IS 'standard public schema';
#+end_src

* EngineYard

  Create a backup: ~sudo -i eybackup -e postgresql --new-backup~
