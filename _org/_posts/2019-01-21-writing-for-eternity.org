Something I would like to do more this year is to share my thoughts
with a teacher mindset.

I would like to do so for two main reasons:

- Improve my learning. Teaching is one of the best way to learn
- Happiness. I genuinely enjoy sharing things that I consider useful.

To do this I would like to write with the idea that my website will
survive me and stay available after my death. This way what I learned
will be useful for a very long period of time. It could even be useful
as Archaeological content for future History teachers. I am dreaming a
lot here but It is useful to start with the end goal in mind.

So *the first step* is to find a permanent home for my website. This
permanent home should be free so that even after my death, not paying
hosting bills will not mean the deletion of my website.

My current strategy is to host my website on [[https://pages.github.com/][GitHub pages]]. GitHub is
one (the?) largest code repository for developers. It was bought by
Microsoft a few month ago. Those are signs that GitHub should stay up
for a pretty long time. Also it is currently free to host a website
using GitHub pages.

*The second step* is to repeat the first step. I am not comfortable
entrusting the future of my website to one single organization. Thus I
need mirrors for my websites and I have set up something similar to
GitHub pages on [[https://pages.bitbucket.io/][Bitbucket]].

My website is now accessible at:
- https://aurelienbottazini.github.io/
- https://aurelienbottazini.bitbucket.io/

Both repositories are also public:
- https://github.com/aurelienbottazini/aurelienbottazini.github.io
- https://bitbucket.org/aurelienbottazini/aurelienbottazini.bitbucket.io/src/master/

I will try to add more mirrors in the future.
