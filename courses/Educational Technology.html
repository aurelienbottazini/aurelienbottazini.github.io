<li>Behaviorism
The term behaviorism refers to the school of psychology founded by
John B. Watson based on the belief that behaviors can be measured,
trained, and changed.
</li>
<li>Constructivism - <i>Piaget</i>
Constructivism is a theory of knowledge that argues that humans
generate knowledge and meaning from an interaction between their
experiences and their ideas.
</li>
<li>Constructionism - <i>Papert</i> - Inspired by Constructivism
Stresses the importance of tools.
Constructivism advocates student-centred, discovery learning where
students use information they previously know to acquire more
knowledge. This is done through participation in project-based
learning where students are able to make connections between
different ideas and areas of knowledge that the teacher helps them
to form

<p>
It is very different to truly understand something than to simply go
through repeated trials and errors to find the solution to a
problem.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Generative topics.
Not all topics (concepts, themes, theories, historical periods,
ideas, and so on) lend themselves equally to teaching for
understanding. For instance, it is easier to teach statistics and
probability for understanding than quadratic equations
</li>
<li>Understanding goals.
The trouble with generative topics is that they are almost
too generative. Each topic offers the opportunity to develop many
different understandings. To create focus, teachers have found it
useful to identify a few specific understanding goals for a topic.
It has also proven helpful to list these goals in phrases of the
form. “Students will understand that &#x2026;” or “Students will
appreciate that&#x2026;.”
</li>
<li>Understanding performances.
</li>
<li>Ongoing assessment.
Traditionally, assessment comes at the end of a topic and focuses on
grading and accountability. These are important functions in many
contexts, but they do not serve students' learning needs. To learn
for understanding, students need criteria, feedback, and
opportunities for reflection from the beginning of and throughout
any sequence of instruction.

</p>

<p>
Abstract:
An intelligent tutoring system is computer software designed to
simulate a human tutor’s behavior and guidance. Because these
systems are able to interpret complex student responses and can
learn as they operate, they are able to discern where and why a
student’s understanding has gone astray and to offer hints to help
the student understand the material at hand. Intelligent tutors
provide many of the benefits of a human tutor to very large
numbers of students. Intelligent tutoring systems can also provide
real-time data to instructors and developers looking to refine
teaching methods.

<p>
Sometimes it is hard to get “real” when you teach. Models are
good but not enough. It is important to put it in a real world
context.
Some people (most?) need reflections after game play.
</p>

<p>
Constructivism: constructing your own knowledge while
constructing a thing.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes we teach something so well we forget what it is like
to learn for the first time.
</p>

<p>
Teachers may be afraid to engage in active learning because
they are afraid to not know all the answers. Often students are
more resourceful that what we might expect.

An assessment is to test students on what they know and on what they
can do.
</p>

<p>
An assessment can be
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt> <i>Formative</i> </dt><dd>provides feedback to improve learning experience
</dd>
<dt> <i>Summative</i> </dt><dd>ex: midterm
</dd>
<dt> a <i>performance</i> assessment </dt><dd>focus on task and how students
perform on an activity. Application of knowledge
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
An assessment can be summative, formative and check performance at
the same time.
</p>

<p>
In a game it is hard to distinguish learning from assessment.
<i>Rise of Nations</i> is a game with good graphs at the end of battles.
</p>

<p>
Teaching for solving problems is much better than regular
assessments.
</p>

<p>
We should view assessments viewed as a process rather than a thing.
If we can forget grades, we can focus assessment comments on what
students should do next.
<i>Stealth assessment</i>: An assessment where you blur the frontier
between learning and the actual test.
</p>

<p>
It is evolving but we are still only adapting what we have on
textbooks. There’s not much large scale change yet.
</p>

<p>
Assessment qualities:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Fairness
</li>
<li>Validity
</li>
<li>Reliability
</li>
<li>Comparability
</li>
</ul>

<p>
If an assessment is too open minded, students get lost.
Grit is a great predictor of success.
</p>

<p>
Be careful on what you measure.
Choose to engage in critical thinking. It is very different than
just doing trial and error.
</p>

<p>
Future of assessments: data mining and data analysis.
The real challenge is to find what is important.

<i>Design Based Research</i> is a systematic but flexible methodology
aimed to improve educational practices through iterative analysis,
design, development, and implementation, based on collaboration
among researchers and practitioners in real-world settings, and
leading to contextually-sensitive design principles and theories
</p>

<p>
<i>DBR</i> takes an idea and iterates on that idea. It is important to
take context into consideration
</p>

<p>
<i>DBIR</i> stands for design based implementation research. It is <i>DBR</i>
going out in the world. <i>DBIR</i> starts with <i>DBR</i> and tries to recast
it into something possible in the real world.
</p>

<p>
With <i>DBR</i>, researchers are not the users. Teachers and students are.
