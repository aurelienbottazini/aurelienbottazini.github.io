Conversations For Action and Collected Essays
=============================================
Instilling a Culture of Commitment in Working Relationships
-----------------------------------------------------------
**Those are my personal notes**. Original book by _Fernando Flores_

We invent reality together in the commitments we make to each other

Requests, promises, offers, assessments, and declarations, serve as building blocks for activating and fulfilling commitments in working relationships.

Designing work to produce value is very different from designing work for maximizing the self-interest of each party involved.

Personal agendas are replaced with a missionary type responsibility for customers and for the organizations.

Assessments are tied up with moods; One must speak to the mood that a person is in.

**People are increasingly stressed by their working relationships.**

Think about what we are creating of value together rather than the ongoing stress of attempting to calculate tradeoffs of individual interests.

Nobody was charged with taking care of the problem.

We propose that we make things happen in the commitments we make to each other.

Your customer ~~may~~ does not know exactly what will ideally satisfy him or her.

This perspective—managing conversations simplify our understanding of action and work.

In its simplest form, the conversation for action consists of four separate speech acts:        
1. Request or offer
2. Promise or acceptance
3. Declaration of completion
4. Declaration of satisfaction.

**Both unfulfilled promises and unnecessary requests can destroy trust between people.**

Although we typically don’t like to do either, **declining and revoking requests** are important moves in coordinating action with others.

Often people fulfill promises but forget to communicate to the concerned party the fulfillment, and then they complain because the concerned party does not acknowledge completion. Both acts are crucial for effective action to continue occurring.

- How do we distinguish work that creates value for the customer from work that’s simply bureaucratic waste?
- How do we stress teamwork and give people more autonomy, yet still be clear on who’s accountable for what?
- How do we ensure that everyone has the same understanding of the context and purpose of the work and their role in it, so that people act in unison?
- How do we build stronger, trusting relationships internally as well as with customers?

Miscoordination has a lasting and damaging effect: it erodes the trust that’s fundamental to relationships.

The question is, how can we begin to observe and improve our habits for coordinating our commitments, making ourselves more trustworthy and more effective in furthering action for ourselves and others?

The central feature of conversations for possibilities is the conversations you have with yourself and with others in which you declare things like the kind of person you are, the roles you’re willing to play, the family and relationships you will have, the career you’ll follow, the projects you’ll undertake, and what will work for you.

The first essential element of a conversation for possibilities is the declaration of a break.

“I declare that I need to engage in a conversation for possibilities.”

The second essential, to be spoken **repeatedly** during this conversation, is the declaration of the possibility itself.

When we work on projects with others, **we’re constantly assessing their work and they, ours.**

Making assessments about the future, we will see, **does not produce the same type of stress as does trying to predict to the future**. People struggle with decision making as they try to predict the future, rather than make assessments about the future.

Believing your information is truth can blind you to different interpretations and possibilities. On the other hand, trying to be open to all possibilities by gathering all the information you can find will lead to information overload and paralysis.

The whole point of making decisions: taking action.

When people make assertions and assessments, they’re making commitments to each other about how to coordinate their actions.

Unlike an assertion, an assessment can never be directly witnessed.

It’s critical that the standards for assessing satisfactory performance are clearly articulated and shared by all community members.

When someone makes the assessment that there’s no action to be taken toward some concern, and no hope of the situation changing in the future, we say that they’re stuck in **resignation** in that domain.

Negative assessment: Do you have any suggestions about what I can do to shift your assessment and hence make a stronger contribution to our team?
Positive assessment: Do you have any suggestions about what I can do to capitalize on this assessment and hence make a stronger contribution to our team?

Fundamental Elements of an Assessment The act of assessing requires that all the following elements appear in the listening of the relevant parties: Speaker commits him- or herself to a verdict (can be about a person, a group, an event, an object, etc.). An assessment can be grounded or ungrounded, but never true or false.

To be grounded, an assessment requires the following additional elements:
- The speaker is clear about the concern for which he or she is making the assessment.
- This concern limits the domain of the assessment.
- The speaker can articulate the standards he or she is using to make the assessment.
- The speaker can provide assertions to support the assessment.
- The speaker can present a hypothesis of recurrent evidence to support using the past to anticipate the future.

Fundamental Elements of an Assertion:
- Speaker commits him- or herself that x is true.
- Speaker includes an implicit offer to provide evidence.
- The assertion answers a question of the hearer’s, either spoken or unspoken.
- It can be judged true or false by the hearer. It is sincere.

Understanding how to make well-grounded assessments allows us to give and receive “opinions” from others not just about work, but about ourselves, our personalities.

When we forget that characterization is a conversation, we perpetuate our competencies and incompetencies, and those of others.

Third, to say that someone is reliable is to speculate that she will act in the future as she’s acted in the past. We commit to such speculation about the future whenever we make a “characterization.”

A characterization is well grounded when:
- You supply assertions about specific actions that a person has repeated several times in the past
- You confine your characterization to a domain of verifiable actions
- You’re aware that your characterization also speculates about how that person will act in the future
- You’re not certain of this; you can only anticipate, given your assertions about his or her performance in the past.

The point is that characterizations can prompt us to action. **Characterizations don’t settle permanent levels of competence**. When we’re dissatisfied and characterize ourselves negatively, or when we choose to increase our competence in some domain in which we already characterize ourselves positively, **we can take action**.

Most people have an interpretation of mood and emotion that limits their power to observe and change their moods.

By taking moods out of the purely personal, subjective realm and into the realm of assessment, companies can begin to take action to produce and shift moods in their organizations, teams, and customer relationships

When a person decides that a negative assessment is ungrounded, that in itself often begins to break the mood.

If people do not recognize that moods and assessments can be examined and shifted in this way, negative moods threaten to become permanent lifestyles.

Managers need to watch the moods of their team and help individuals to manage their moods.

When we see a particularly effective team at work, the team members seem to be “in tune”’ with each other.

life is something that they are inventing, or life is something that happens to them, and they react to their circumstances.

Cynicism is a kind of resignation in which a person ***has given up on the possibility of change***.


Victimization is an attitude in which all of a person’s moods and circumstances **are the fault of others, or of an unresponsive system.**


The resentful person feels that other people in the organization aren’t pulling their weight, **but isn’t about to say that outside of a small group of friends.**


**As you identify a negative mood in a particular domain of your life, please follow the following guidelines for exploring your mood and the possibility of shifting it.**

1. Awareness Become aware of your sensations (feelings).
2. Choice Are you ready to make a commitment to alter this mood? If yes, continue to number three; otherwise, by when will you decide, or are you at peace with this situation and do not see a need to alter your mood?
3. Investigation—what or who is this mood about? What is the narrative you tell yourself while in this mood? Is it based on an assessment or an assertion? If it is an assessment, is it grounded or not? What standards are you using? Are they shared by the people you work with? If it is an assertion, is it true or false? If true, what is it going to take for you to accept this? If you realize that it is based on a false assertion, does your realization begin to shift your mood? If not, is your negative mood really about something else?
4. Plan for Action What’s missing? Which of the moves from the coordination cycle do you need to make (revoke, counteroffer, request, etc.) to bring about what is missing? Do you need to make a complaint? Do you need to apologize?
5. Take Action With whom and by when?
6. Complete Have new opportunities opened up as the result of completing this exercise? If so, what request or offer could you now make?

Trust is crucial, not only for internal relationships, but for customer relationships as well.

Trust is built in relationships when we demonstrate real concern about the well-being of others and manage our commitments rigorously.

This is rarely a conscious decision. Generally, we experience this mood as an undifferentiated attitude about a person.

Sincerity, competence, reliability, and engagement

Sincerity: The assessment that a performer is serious in his or her commitments. The performer does not make promises that he or she does not intend to fulfill or that he or she is unable or incompetent to complete. Competence: The assessment that a performer is capable of performance in some domain. The performer builds this assessment by recurrently performing according to accepted standards. Reliability: The assessment that a performer is capable of reliable and timely performance. The performer builds this assessment via the recurrent and rigorous management of his or her promises, by either completing promises on time or counteroffering, revoking, or declining in a timely fashion. Engagement: The assessment that a performer is committed to the future well-being of the customer and the possibilities for collaboration. The performer builds this assessment by listening to the concerns of the customer and continually articulating new conditions of satisfaction for them. The performer also demonstrates respect for the customer as a partner by respecting confidentiality and refraining from alliances with competitors.

Dignity. It is important not to become slaves to our promises, attempting to complete all our commitments despite the cost to ourselves.

Furthermore, there are actions that we can take to reduce the cost of breaking a promise and preserve our reputation for reliability. We need to promptly alert the person to whom we made the promise.

A company can deliver excellent service on only one occasion.
On the other hand, a team can persist by sheer inertia when it is no longer needed.
If a company has little competition or the cost of switching between providers is large, customers can become trapped in an unsatisfying relationship. In this case, market conditions, and not superior service, maintain the relationship.

Leadership as the ability to build teams through cultivating the right conversations at the right times.

This chapter makes two central claims: Leadership is a phenomenon of the conversations of a team, not of an individual. In these conversations, the leader takes action to ensure that the conversations of the team take place and that these conversations are assessed by the team to be effective. The leader is the person who’s granted authority by the team to take care of these conversations in an ongoing manner; A team participates in a set of ongoing conversations among people who commit to share an explicitly declared mission and to coordinate actions to fulfill the mission.

Lack of ownership shows up as negligence, lack of passion, and resignation.

1. A commitment to coordinating action for the sake of a shared, explicitly declared mission.
2. A commitment to own the shared mission.
3. A commitment to fulfill roles by each team member, with explicit accountabilities.
4. A commitment to develop and carry on practices for anticipation.
5. Commitment to the team’s unity of command and to the political declarations of the team.
6. A commitment to evoke and produce trust.

The leader makes clear initial declarations of roles and clarifies them or modifies them whenever interpretations diverge from the initial identity that was declared for each team member.

Note that people on a successful team commit to the **leader’s being the team’s political authority, and grant him or her the authority to execute his or her declarations.**

The leader ensures that each teammate’s commitments are managed rigorously.
When people are incompetent or unreliable, the leader takes action to redefine the roles in the team and/or to provide coaching.

**The leader is the guardian of the team’s mood.**

Teams don’t survive when members behave like mercenaries. In successful teams, participants fuse their personal identity with the team’s identity and develop a concern for the team’s future viability.

To excel as a leader is to put together and to orchestrate a team that has strong competencies to be successful.

To excel as a leader is also to be competent in building alliances and bringing in help where competence is lacking.

Fundamentally, the agreement of leader and team must be that the team members **satisfy the leader in the performance of their duties**.

Nearly everyone concedes now that listening to another person is a **difficult skill to master**. It requires more than just hearing and understanding the words enunciated; it also requires **figuring out what the other person assumes and therefore leaves unsaid**.

The point of listening is to develop a shared disclosive space, to develop a new relationship, in which each has a role that may be developed.

the first structuring principle of listening is attending to the charged distinctions generated in the course of the mutual experience, the shared disclosive space.

The second structuring feature of good listening is that it attends to distinctions that draw out or draw upon or collect as rich as possible a deposit of skills and aptitudes in the other.

that the principle of articulation produces wonder in us, and the principle of collaboration produces a sense of resonance.

Good sales professionals become passionately engaged in knowing as much as they can about their own products and look to work with the customer to find ways of making his or her business more productive by using these products.

Listening isn’t about receiving information; listening is about building a rapport.
