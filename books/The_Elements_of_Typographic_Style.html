This is the best book on Typography.
The book in itself is so carefully written and edited. It is a joy
to read. It is a must for anyone interested in typography.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>½ em = 1 en. One em is a distance equal to the type size.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
For example a 6 point font has an em equal to 6 point, a twelve
font to 12 point etc.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a 66 character line is widely regarded as ideal. On page 29,
</li>
</ul>
<p>
there is a diagram showing how to get to this ideal line based on
line length and alphabet length
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For strings of capitals, small caps and long string of
</li>
</ul>
<p>
digits, specific letter spacing may be needed.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Kerning = altering the space between selected pair of
</li>
</ul>
<p>
letters. It exists kerning tables. Numbers need kerning too but
are not often kerned.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Lead = Interlinear space. Measured from one baseline to the
other.
</li>
<li>Font 11/13 = Font font size/lead
</li>
<li>Vertical space consumed by each departure (headings,
</li>
</ul>
<p>
subheads, quotations etc.) should be an even multiple of the basic
leading. For 13: 26, 39, 52, 65, 78, 91, 104 etc.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Paragraph indent: most of the time 1 em or 1 lead.
</li>
<li>Never begin a page with the last line of a multi line
paragraph.
</li>
<li>Link short numerical and mathematical expression with hard
</li>
</ul>
<p>
space. If a break is needed, break after equal sign on on another
clear logical pause.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Avoid more than three consecutive hyphenated lines
</li>
<li>Abandon any and all rules of hyphenation and pagination that

fail to serve the needs of the text.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Limit the number of size. Start with one size and work slowly
from here
</li>
<li>Use titling figures (uppercase numerals) with full caps and
text figures (lowercase numerals) in all other circumstances.
</li>
<li>For abbreviation and acronyms in the midst of normal text, use
small caps.
ex: USA is a country.
But we use Unesco instead of UNESCO because we pronounce it as
word not as letter.
</li>
<li>Check if font has good ligatures.
For example with the word Coeur in French
</li>
<li>Prefer true italic over sloped fonts
</li>
<li>Experiment by changing one parameter at a time (to set the
title for example).
</li>
<li>Punctuation not in bold. It is the word, not the punctuation
that merit emphasis.

<li>separating the first and/or final column from adjacent empty
space, ordinarily servers no function.
</li>
<li>p72 for a good example

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>ANALPHABETIC SYMBOLS
</li>

<li>Midpoint or small bullet • for marking phrases or abbreviations.
</li>
<li>Use analphabetic symbols and diacritics that are in tune with
the basic font.

<li>Analphabetic characters notorious for poor design
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>[] too dark

<li>Steeper slash is the virgule / (alternative form of the
comma). Useful in dates and in text
</li>
<li>Solidus or fraction bar ½ (vulgar fraction unicode)
</li>
<li>Virgule used to construct level fraction 2π/3
</li>
<li>Dimension (multiplication) sign × instead of x for dimensions.
</li>
<li>Use upright rather than sloped parenthesis even if the context
is italic
</li>
<li>“outside and ‛inside’ quotation”
</li>
<li>Dr and Prof. (omit period when abbreviation stars with first
letter and ends with the last letter of the word).
</li>
<li>Use accents and alternate sorts that proper names and imported
word and phrase require.

<li>Remap the font driver and keyboard to suit your own
requirements.

</li>
<li>Choose faces that will survive, and if possible prosper, under
the final printing conditions.

<li>Choose faces that suit the paper your intend to print on, or
choose a paper that suits the face you wish to use.

<li>Choose a face that suit the task as well as the subject

a:b = b:(a+b)
1:ϕ (phi). It is a ratio of 38.2%/61.8% or approximately
1/1.6

<li>Fibonacci series are very good to choose type size
5•8•13•21•34•55…
Interlocking series can also be used
4•7•11•18•29…
6•10•16•26•42… (this one is doubling Finobacci so it is
special and can be used to form a two stranded Finobacci)

</li>
<li>Choose inherently satisfying page proportions in
preference to stock sizes or arbitrary shapes.
</li>
<li>Choose page proportions suited to the content, size and
ambition of the publication
</li>
<li>If the text is meant to invite continuous reading, set it
in columns that are clearly taller than wide.
</li>
<li>Shape the text-block so that it balances and contrasts
with the shape of the overall page. p164 shows a good
example of a text-block.
</li>
<li>Bring the margins into the design
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Lock the text-block to the page and lock the facing
pages to each other
</li>
<li>Frame the text-block
</li>
<li>protect the text-block

</ul>
</li>
<li>Bring the design into the margins
Paragraphs indents, blank lines, marginal notes…
</li>
<li>Mark the reader's way. Folios are useful in documents
larger than two pages. p165
</li>
<li>Don't restate the obvious
Running heads are bad except in anthologies and works of reference.
</li>
<li>Modular scales are better than grids because they are
more flexible. Grids are used when unpredictable
elements must be combined in a rapid and orderly way.
p169 shows an example of page layouts.
</li>
<li>Adjusts the type and the spaces within the text-block
using typographic increments, but rely on free
proportions to adjust the empty space.

<li>Keep the design supple enough to provide a livable home
for the text

<li>If text figures, ligatures or other glyphs you need on a
