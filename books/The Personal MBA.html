<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Companies</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Large companies move slowly. Good ideas often died on the vine
simply because they had to be approved by too many people.
</p>

<p>
Climbing the corporate ladder is an obstacle to doing great
work. I wanted to focus on getting things done and making
things better, not constantly positioning myself for promotion.
Politics and turf wars are an inescapable part of the daily
experience of working for a large company. 3. Frustration leads
to burnout. I wanted to enjoy the daily experience of work, but
instead I felt like I was running a gauntlet each day. It began
to affect my health, happiness, and relationships. The longer I
stayed in the corporate world, the more I realized I wanted
out. I desperately wanted to work on my own terms, as an
entrepreneur.
</p>

<p>
Less skilled managers are actually more likely to be rewarded,
since everyone can see them “making things happen” and “moving
heaven and earth” to resolve issues—issues they may have created
themselves via poor management.

<p>
Congratulations: you’ve used your intelligence and drive to
condemn yourself to the life of an indentured servant.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
Business schools don’t create successful people. They simply
accept them, then take credit for their success.
</p>

<p>
If you get in, the school will do what it can to help you get a
decent job, but making things happen will always be your
responsibility.
</p>

<p>
The one significant benefit that business schools do provide is
better access to Fortune 50 recruiters, consulting firms, large
accounting firms, and investment banks via on-campus recruiting
and alumni networks.

<p>
If you find something broken that you can fix for a lot of people,
you’ve found a gold mine.
</p>

<p>
If you discover that you have what people want, great—full steam
ahead. If there’s no demand for what you’re developing, you can
quickly and cleanly move on to the next promising idea.
</p>

<p>
If you’re not embarrassed by the first version of your product,
you’ve launched too late.
</p>

<p>
Developing and testing a Minimum Economically Viable
Offer (MEVO) is important: it’s the best way to determine
whether or not you’ve created something valuable enough to sell
before you invest your life savings.

<h2 id="sec-7"><span class="section-number-2">7</span> Business</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
<p>
No business plan survives first contact with customers.
</p>

<p>
Business is about creating and delivering value to paying
customers, not orchestrating legal fraud. Unfortunately for us
all, business schools have de-emphasized the former in favor of
teaching the latter.
</p>

<p>
Roughly defined, a business is a repeatable process that:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Creates and delivers something of value
</li>
<li>That other people  want or need
</li>
<li>At a price they’re willing to pay
</li>
<li>In a way that satisfies the customer’s needs and expectations
</li>
<li>So that the business brings in enough profit to make it
worthwhile for the  owners to continue operation.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Every successful business actually delivers what it promises to
its customers.
</p>

<p>
HERE’S WHAT MAKES A BUSINESS RESILIENT:
— Low (preferably zero) outstanding debt
— Low overhead, fixed costs, and operating expenses
— Substantial cash reserves for unexpected contingencies
— Multiple independent products/industries/lines of business
— Flexible workers/employees who can handle many responsibilities
well
— No single points of failure —Fail-safes/backup systems for all core processes
</p>

<h2 id="sec-8"><span class="section-number-2">8</span> Competition</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-8">
<p>
Learn everything you can from your competition, and then create
something even more valuable.
</p>

<p>
Don’t focus on competing. Focus on delivering even more value. Your
competition will take care of itself.

<div id="outline-container-sec-9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-9"><span class="section-number-2">9</span> Marketing</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-9">
<p>
Without Marketing, no business can survive—people who don’t know
you exist can’t purchase what you have to offer, and people who
aren’t interested in what you have to offer won’t become paying
customers.
</p>

<p>
Marketing is about getting noticed.
Sales is about closing the deal.
</p>

<p>
Rule #1 of Marketing is that your potential customer’s available
attention is limited.
</p>

<p>
In order to be noticed, you need to find a way to earn that
attention by being more interesting or useful than the competing
alternatives.
</p>

<p>
If you want to attract Attention quickly, give something valuable
away for Free.
</p>

<p>
Here’s an example: Almost everyone will ignore postal junk mail—if
it looks blatantly commercial or mass-produced, there’s a 99
percent chance the recipient will throw it away without a second
thought. Change the form, however, and Receptivity changes as
well. Most people will at least open a hand-addressed envelope,
since it’s clear someone spent time and effort sending it to them.
Taken to an extreme, almost everyone (including busy executives)
will open and look through the contents of a large overnight
hand-addressed FedEx envelope—it’s big, expensive, and clearly
requires effort to send. Even then, if the contents don’t match
what they’re interested in, you’ll lose their attention
immediately.
</p>

<p>
Being Remarkable is the best way to attract Attention. In the
classic marketing book Purple Cow, Seth Godin uses a wonderful
metaphor to illustrate this principle. A field full of brown cows
is boring. A purple cow violates the viewer’s expectations, which
naturally attracts Attention and interest.
</p>

<p>
Attempting to appeal to everyone is a waste of time and money:
focus your marketing efforts on your Probable Purchaser.
</p>

<p>
Marketing is most effective when it focuses on the desired End
Result
</p>

<p>
Your job as a marketer isn’t to convince people to want what
you’re offering: it’s to help your prospects convince themselves
that what you’re offering will help them get what they really
want.
</p>

<p>
Framing is the act of emphasizing the details that are critically
important while de-emphasizing things that aren’t, by either
minimizing certain facts or leaving them out entirely.
</p>

<p>
A Hook is a single phrase or sentence that describes an offer’s
primary benefit.
</p>

<p>
Ensure that every message you create has a clear Call-To-Action,
and you’ll dramatically increase the effectiveness of your
marketing activities.
</p>

<p>
Used constructively, Controversy can be an effective way to
attract Attention
</p>

<p>
Building your Reputation takes time and effort, but it’s the most
effective kind of marketing there is.
</p>

<p>
Add a bit of Social Proof to your offers, and your sales will
soar.
</p>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-sec-9-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-9-1"><span class="section-number-3">9.1</span> Contrast</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-1">
<p>
Contrast is often used to influence buying decisions.
</p>

<p>
Take advantage of Contrast when presenting your offer, and you’ll
increase the odds that your potential customers will view your
offer favorably.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-9-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-9-2"><span class="section-number-3">9.2</span> Sales Objections</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-2">
<p>
There are five standard objections that appear in sales of all
kinds:
</p>

<p>
Objection #1 (“it costs too much”) is best addressed via Framing
and Value-Based Selling.
</p>

<p>
Objections #2 and #3 (“it won’t work” / “it won’t work for me”)
are best addressed via Social Proof—showing
</p>

<p>
Objections #4 and #5 (“I can wait” / “it’s too difficult”) are
best addressed via Education-Based Selling.
</p>

<p>
Loss Aversion is the idea that people hate to lose things more
than they like to gain them.
</p>

<p>
The best way to overcome Loss Aversion is to Reinterpret the risk
of loss as “no big deal.”
</p>

<p>
Eliminate this perception of risk by offering a money-back
guarantee or similar Risk Reversal offer, and people will feel the
decision is less risky, resulting in more sales.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-9-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-9-3"><span class="section-number-3">9.3</span> Scarcity</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-3">
<p>
Scarcity encourages people to make decisions quickly. Scarcity is
one of the things that naturally overcomes our tendency to
conserve—if you want something that’s scarce, you can’t afford to
wait without the risk of losing what you want.
</p>

<p>
As a result, adding a Scarcity element to your offer is a great
way to encourage people to take action.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Limited Quantities—inform prospects that you’re offering a limited number of units for sale.
</li>
<li>Price Increases—inform prospects that the price will go up in the near future.
</li>
<li>Price Decreases—inform prospects that a current discount will
</li>
</ol>
<p>
end in the near future. 4. Deadlines—inform prospects that the
offer is only good for a limited period of time.
</p>

<p>
Add an element of Scarcity to your offer, and you’ll encourage
people to buy now instead of “later.”
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-9-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-9-4"><span class="section-number-3">9.4</span> New</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-4">
<p>
Novelty—the presence of new sensory data—is critical if you want
to attract and maintain attention over a long period of time. One
of the reasons people can focus on playing games or surfing the
Internet for hours at a time is novelty—every new viral video,
blog post, Facebook update, Twitter post, and news report
reengages our ability to pay attention.
</p>

<p>
Continue to offer something new, and people will pay attention to
what you have to offer.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-10" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-10"><span class="section-number-2">10</span> Customers</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-10">
<p>
Screening your customers can help you filter out the bad customers
before they do business with you.
</p>

<p>
Attracting your Probable Purchaser’s Attention immediately after
they’ve reached the Point of Market Entry is hugely valuable.
</p>

<p>
If you can get a prospective customer’s attention as soon as they
become interested in what you’re offering, you become the standard
by which competing offers are evaluated.
</p>

<p>
Addressability is a measure of how easy it is to get in touch with
people who might want what you’re offering.
</p>

<p>
If you encourage your prospects to Visualize what their life will
look like after purchasing, you increase the probability that
they’ll purchase from you.
</p>

<p>
Permission is a real asset. Reaching new people tends to be
difficult and expensive. It’s far easier to follow up with someone
you already know—all
</p>

<p>
Before asking your prospects for Permission to follow up, make it
clear what they’ll be getting and how it’ll benefit them.
</p>

<p>
Tell your prospective customers the stories they’re interested in
hearing, and you’ll inevitably grab their Attention.
</p>

<p>
Building a trustworthy Reputation over time by dealing fairly and
honestly is the best way to build Trust.
</p>

<p>
Education-Based Selling is the process of making your prospects
better, more informed customers.
</p>

<p>
Reactivation is the process of convincing past customers to buy
from you again.
</p>

<p>
Make it a priority every three to six months to contact your
lapsed customers with another offer to see if you can encourage
them to start buying again, and you’ll be amazed by the results.
</p>

<p>
Lifetime Value is the total value of a customer’s business over
the lifetime of their relationship with your company. The more a
customer purchases from you and the longer they stay with you, the
more valuable that customer is to your business.
</p>

<p>
Once you understand the Lifetime Value of a prospect, you can
calculate the maximum amount of time and resources you’re willing
to spend to acquire a new prospect.
</p>

<p>
Perceptual Control represents a fundamental shift in understanding
why people do the things they do. Once you understand that people
act to control their perceptions, you’ll be better equipped to
influence how they act.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-10-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-10-1"><span class="section-number-3">10.1</span> Allowable Acquisition Cost</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-10-1">
<p>
Allowable Acquisition Cost (AAC) is the marketing component of
Lifetime Value. The higher the average customer’s Lifetime Value,
the more you can spend to attract a new customer, making it
possible to spread the word about your offer in new ways.
</p>

<p>
To calculate your market’s Allowable Acquisition Cost, start with
your average customer’s Lifetime Value, then subtract your Value
Stream costs—what it takes to create and deliver the value
promised to that customer over your entire relationship with them.
Then subtract your Overhead (discussed later) divided by your
total customer base, which represents the Fixed Costs (discussed
later) you’ll need to pay to stay in business over that period of
time. Multiply the result by 1 minus your desired Profit Margin
(if you’re shooting for a 60 percent margin, you’d use 1.00 - 0.60
= 0.40), and that’s your Allowable Acquisition Cost. Here’s an
example: if your average Lifetime Value is $2,000 over a five-year
period, and the cost of Value Creation and delivery is $500, that
leaves you with $1,500 in revenue per customer served. Assuming
your Overhead expenses are $500,000 over the same five-year period
and you have 500 customers, your Fixed Costs are $1,000 per
customer, which leaves you with $500 in revenue before marketing
expenses. Assuming you’re shooting for a minimum 60 percent profit
margin, you can afford to spend 40 percent of that $500 on
marketing, which gives you a maximum AAC of $200 per customer.

Yes, you’ll lose money on customers who are obviously taking

compensation, by eliminating the risk that every purchaser feels,
you’ll close many more sales and come out way ahead in terms of

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-13">
<p>
If you expect people to pay you perfectly good money to buy what
you’re offering, you must be able to provide a Reason Why the
offered price is worth paying.
</p>

<p>
There are four ways to support a price on something of value:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>replacement cost :: The Replacement Cost method supports a price
by answering the question “How much would it cost to replace?”
</li>
<li>market comparison :: The Market Comparison method supports a
price by answering the question “How much are other things like
this selling for?”
</li>
<li>discounted cash flow / net present value :: The Discounted Cash
Flow (DCF) / Net Present Value (NPV) method supports a price by
answering the question “How much is it worth if it can bring in
money over time?”
</li>
<li>value comparison :: The Value Comparison method supports a price
by answering the question “Who is this particularly valuable
to?”
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Value Comparison is typically the optimal way to price your offer,
since the value of an offer to a specific group can be quite high,
resulting in a much better price. Use the other methods as a
baseline, but focus on discovering how much your offer is worth to
the party you hope to sell it to, then set your price
appropriately.
</p>

<p>
Value-Based Selling is the process of understanding and
reinforcing the Reasons Why your offer is valuable to the
purchaser.
</p>

<p>
If you discover why, how, and how much your offer will benefit the
customer, you’ll be able to explain that value in terms they’ll
understand and appreciate. Understanding the value you can provide
your customers is the golden path to a profitable sale.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-14">
<p>
There are always many paths to a successful Transaction, which is
the essence of negotiation. Negotiation is the process of
exploring different options to find Common Ground.
Your Next Best Alternative is what you’ll do in the event you
can’t find Common Ground with the party you’re negotiating with.
</p>

<p>
In every negotiation, there are Three Universal Currencies:
resources, time, and flexibility.
</p>

<p>
Keep the Three Universal Currencies in mind when negotiating,
</p>

<p>
The Three Dimensions of Negotiation are setup, structure, and
discussion.
</p>

<p>
Setup: setting the stage for a satisfying outcome to the
negotiation.
</p>

<p>
Structure: the terms of the proposal. In this phase, you put
together your draft proposal in a way they’re likely to appreciate
and accept:
</p>

<p>
Discussion: actually presenting the offer to the other party.
</p>

<p>
A Buffer is a third party empowered to negotiate on your behalf.
Agents, attorneys, mediators, brokers, accountants, and other
similar subject-matter experts are all examples of Buffers.
</p>

<p>
As a rule of thumb: don’t give anyone unfettered control over
decisions that directly affect your money.
</p>

Buffers can be a hugely valuable resource as long as you’re clear
about how they’ll be rewarded, what they’re responsible for, and
how you intend to work together.

Value Delivery involves everything necessary to ensure that every
paying customer is a happy customer: order processing, inventory
management, delivery/fulfillment, troubleshooting, customer
support, etc. Without Value Delivery, you don’t have a business.
</p>

<p>
A Value Stream is the set of all steps and all processes from the
start of your Value Creation process all the way through the
delivery of the end result to your customer. Understanding what
your offer’s Value Stream looks like is critically important if
you want to be able to deliver value to your customers quickly,
reliably, and consistently.
</p>

<p>
A customer’s perception of quality relies on two criteria:
expectations and performance. You can characterize this
relationship in the form of a quasi-equation, which I call the
Expectation Effect: Quality = Performance - Expectations.
</p>

<p>
The best way to consistently surpass expectations is to give your
customers an unexpected bonus in addition to the value they
expect.
</p>

<p>
Every improvement you make to your Value Stream make it harder for
potential competitors to keep up.
</p>

<p>
Incremental Augmentation is an example of the power of
Accumulation. If your offer improves with every Iteration Cycle,
it won’t be long before your offer is many times more valuable to
your customers than it was before.

That’s Amplification: making a small change to a scalable System

Inhibition is the ability to temporarily override our natural
inclinations. If you’ve ever put up with one of your siblings (or
colleagues) acting immature, obnoxious, or annoying, Inhibition
prevented you from doing something you would have regretted later.

Dr. Mischel found a correlation between Willpower and success:
kids with a greater ability to “defer gratification” were more
successful in school, as well as later on in life.

<h3 id="sec-20-2"><span class="section-number-3">20.2</span> Lazyness</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-20-2">
<p>
Everyone’s favorite character flaw: procrastination.
</p>

<p>
Here’s a universal truth of human
nature: people are generally lazy. The critical insight is that
being lazy is a feature, not a bug. Think what would happen if one
of your ancient ancestors ran around all day for no good reason
until they collapsed from exhaustion? If a predator or enemy
appeared, they’d have no reserves left to respond to the threat—a
very bad situation. As a result, we’ve evolved to avoid expending
energy unless absolutely necessary, which I call Conservation of
Energy. Over the past several decades, researchers have studied
marathoners and ultramarathoners (people who regularly run fifty
to one hundred miles at a stretch) to learn more about how the
body responds to pain. Here’s what they’ve found: when you’re so
tired that it feels like you’re about to kick the bucket any
second, physiologically, you’re not even remotely close to
actually dying. The signals your brain is sending to your body are
a ruse that serves as a warning, prompting you to keep some energy
in reserve, just in case energy is needed later. Unless a
Reference Level is violated, people generally will Conserve Energy
by not acting. Think of two roommates who share different
standards of household cleanliness. To one, the presence of dirty
dishes in the sink is a problem—in his mind, any dishes at all is
“out of control,” which prompts action to fix the situation. To
the other roommate, the situation may not be out of control until
the sink is overflowing, at which point he’ll expend some energy
washing dishes. Different Reference Levels, different actions. If
you think your weight, health, and physique are just fine, you
probably won’t change your diet or start exercising spontaneously.
If you’re comfortable with your social circle and confidence, you
probably won’t do much to improve your social skills or expand
your circle of acquaintances. If you think you’re making enough
money, you probably won’t do much to earn more. Conservation of
Energy explains why some people stay in dead-end jobs for decades,
even though they know the position isn’t great. If the work is
okay, the bills get paid, and the job never becomes stressful or
frustrating enough to violate expectations, people generally won’t
go out of their way to get a promotion, find another job, or start
a new business. People only start to expend effort if their
Reference Levels are violated in some way, so if their
expectations aren’t violated, they simply don’t act. Sources of
information that change your Reference Levels are valuable in
prompting action. One of the things that prompted me to build
courses and offer consulting was the knowledge that some business
authors and coaches were able to spend all day learning and
helping others, and be paid very well for their expertise. That
was enough to violate my Reference Levels about work at the
time—if they could get paid for doing what I loved to do, why
should I have to spend all day in a day job that was just “okay”?
The more I learned about what people did to make this possible,
the more I wanted to do to make it a reality for myself. Before
Roger Bannister’s record-breaking performance in 1954, running a
mile in under four minutes was considered beyond the physical
limitations of the human body. After Bannister proved it was
possible, the psychological barrier was broken: by the end of
1957, sixteen runners had accomplished the feat. The only thing
that changed was the Reference Level: these athletes knew it was
possible and wanted to do it, so they did. Good books, magazines,
blogs, documentaries, and even competitors are valuable if they
violate your expectations about what’s possible. When you discover
that other people are actually doing something you previously
considered unrealistic or impossible, it changes your Reference
Levels in a very useful way. All you need to know is that
something you want&#x2026;

Always choose the best tools that you can obtain and afford.
Quality tools give you maximum output with a minimum of input. By
investing in Force Multipliers, you free up your time, energy, and

A System is a process made explicit and repeatable—a series of

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-23">
<p>
Personal Cash is by far the best form of financing.
</p>

<p>
Personal Credit is another low-cost method of financing.
</p>

<p>
Personal Loans are typically made by friends and family.
</p>

<p>
Unsecured Loans are typically made by banks and credit unions.
</p>

<p>
Secured Loans require collateral. Mortgages and automotive loans
are good examples of secured loans:
</p>

<p>
Bootstrapping is the art of building and operating a business
without Funding.
</p>



<p>
Bonds are debt sold to individual lenders. Instead of asking a
bank for a loan directly, the business asks individuals or other
companies to loan them money directly.
</p>

<p>
Receivables Financing is a special type of secured lending unique
to businesses. Receivables Financing can make millions of dollars
in credit available, but at a cost: the collateral for the loan is
control over the business’s receivables.
</p>

<p>
Angel Capital is where we shift from Loans to Capital. An “angel”
is an individual private investor—someone who has excess wealth
they’d like to invest in a private business,
</p>

<p>
Venture Capital takes over where angels leave off. Venture
Capitalists (VCs) are extremely wealthy investors (or groups of
investors who pool their funds) with very large sums of Capital
available: tens (or hundreds) of millions of dollars in a single
investment.
</p>

<p>
A Public Stock Offering involves selling partial ownership of the
company to investors on the open market.
</p>

<p>
Investors can collect their returns in one of two ways: reaping
dividends that distribute the Profits of the company or selling
their shares to another investor.
</p>

<p>
Investors increase Communication Overhead
</p>

<p>
Funding can help you do things that would otherwise be impossible
with your current budget.

In order to obtain access to Funding, it’s often necessary to give
up a certain amount of control over the business’s operations.

Believe it or not, there are only four ways to increase your

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-28">
<p>
Reference Level is a range of perceptions that indicate the system is
“under control.”
</p>

<p>
There are three kinds of Reference Levels: set points, ranges, and
errors.
</p>

<p>
A set point is a minimum or maximum value. The thermostat is an
example of a set point—whenever
</p>

<p>
Business financial controls are managed as set points: as long as
your revenue is above a certain set point and your expenses are
below a certain set point, you’re okay.
</p>

<p>
A range is a spread of acceptable values. The difference between a
range and a set point is the existence of an upper and lower limit
to the perception being controlled. With a set point, the
perception must be above or below a certain level to be under
control; with a range, the perception must be between two set
points to be under
</p>

<p>
An error is a set point defined as zero—any perception that’s not
zero is out of control. Think of the pain receptors in your skin.
Most of the time, they do nothing, which means everything is under
control.
</p>

<p>
Consciously defining and redefining Reference Levels can help you
change your behavior.

<p>
Change the Reference Level, and your behavior will change
automatically.

Change the situation that creates the Reference Levels each party

</p>

<p>
humans have the cognitive capacity to keep track of somewhere
around 150 close personal connections. Beyond this limited circle,
we start treating people less like individuals and more like
objects, and groups of people beyond this limit are likely to
splinter off into subgroups over time.
</p>

<p>
There’s some controversy regarding the actual quantity of
connections where Cognitive Scope Limitation kicks in (the
Bernard-Killworth median, a competing estimate, is 231), but
there’s little doubt that such a limit exists.
</p>

<p>
As a result, your mind effortlessly forms Associations—even
between things that aren’t logically connected.

<p>
Everyone knows James Bond is a fictional character, but when
Daniel Craig is featured wearing a tuxedo in a watch

is automatically transferred to the timepiece. Cultivate the right

<h2 id="sec-31"><span class="section-number-2">31</span> Relationships</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-31">
<p>
All human relationships are based on Power—the ability to
influence the actions of other people.
</p>

<p>
The use of Power typically takes one of two fundamental forms:
influence or compulsion. Influence is the ability to encourage
someone else to want what you suggest. Compulsion is the ability
to force someone else to do what you command.
</p>

<p>
On the whole, influence is much more effective than compulsion.
</p>

<p>
The best way to increase your Power is to do things that increase
your influence and Reputation. The more people know your
capabilities and respect the Reputation you’ve built, the more
Power you will have.
</p>

<p>
Focus on what you can do well, and work with others to accomplish
the rest.
</p>

<p>
The more Important you make people feel when they’re around you,
the more they’ll like you and want to be around you.
</p>

<p>
Here’s a fascinating quirk about asking people to do something:
they’ll be far more likely to comply with your request if you give
them a reason to do what you ask.
</p>

<p>
Jim Rohn, author of The Art of Exceptional Living, “You are the
average of the five people you spend the most time with.”

Let others know you expect great work from them, and they’ll do
their best to live up to your expectations.

<p>
Communication Overhead is the proportion of time you spend
communicating with members of your team instead of getting
productive work done.
</p>

<p>
If you’re responsible for working with a group of more than five
to eight people, at least 80 percent of your job will inevitably
be communicating effectively with the people you work with.
</p>

<p>
If you want your team to perform at its best, make your teams as
small and autonomous as possible.
</p>

<p>
The more people available, the less responsibility each member of
the crowd feels to do anything about the situation.

<p>
Based on what we’ve learned thus far, here are six simple
principles of effective real-world Management:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Recruit the smallest group of people who can accomplish what must be done

with a few words of wisdom from B. C. Forbes, the founder of
Forbes magazine, who wrote an essay in 1917 called “Keys to
Success.” I refer to it often, and find that it’s a great reminder
of what business and life are all about: Your success depends on
you. Your happiness depends on you. You have to steer your own
course. You have to shape your own fortune. You have to educate
yourself. You have to do your own thinking. You have to live with
your own conscience. Your mind is yours and can be used only by
you. You come into this world alone. You go to the grave alone.
You are alone with your inner thoughts during the journey between.
You make your own decisions. You must abide by the consequences of
your acts … You alone can regulate your habits and make or unmake
your health. You alone can assimilate things mental and things
material … You have to do your own assimilation all through life.
You can be taught by a teacher, but you have to imbibe the
knowledge. He cannot transfuse it into your brain. You alone can
control your mind cells and your brain cells. You may have spread
before you the wisdom of the ages, but unless you assimilate it
you derive no benefit from it; no one can force it into your
cranium. You alone can move your own legs. You alone can move your
own arms. You alone can utilize your own hands. You alone can
control your own muscles. You must stand on your feet, physically
and metaphorically. You must take your own steps. Your parents
cannot enter into your skin, take control of your mental and
physical machinery, and make something of you. You cannot fight
your son’s battles; that he must do for himself. You have to be
captain of your own destiny. You have to see through your own
eyes. You have to use your own ears. You have to master your own
faculties. You have to solve your own problems. You have to form
your own ideals. You have to create your own ideas. You must
choose your own speech. You must govern your own tongue. Your real
life is your thoughts. Your thoughts are your own making. Your
character is your own handiwork. You alone can select the
materials that go into it. You alone can reject what is not fit to
go into it. You are the creator of your own personality. You can
be disgraced by no man’s hand but your own. You can be elevated
and sustained by no man but yourself. You have to write your own
record. You have to build your own monument—or dig your own pit.
