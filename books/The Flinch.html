<li>The Flinch is your real opponent, and information won't help you
fight it.
</li>
<li>Facing the flinch is hard. It means seeing the lies you tell
yourself, facing the fear behind them, and handling the pain that
your journey demands–all without hesitation.
</li>
<li>It's why you can't quit your job or be the person you want to
be–you can't see the flinch in yourself. The flinch is why you don't
do the work that matters, and why you won't make the hard decisions.
</li>
<li>Have you ever asked yourself why your stomach tenses up and you
can't watch imaginary characters on a television screen do awkward,
embarassing things? You should.
</li>
<li>Think of a bear. You see it, and you react, instantly. You know
how to deal because your brain is built to help you survive it: you
run, jump, fight, or hide. But that's not the world you're in, so
instead, flinching happens at job interviews or when you're asking a
girl to the prom. Those things get magnified. Your privileged-world
problems become the bear, and you treat them that way.
</li>
<li>The lessons you learn the best are those you get burned by.
Without the scar, there's no evidence or strong memory.
</li>
<li>The anxiety of the flinch is almost always worse than the pain
itself. You've forgotten that. You need to learn it again. You need
more scars. You need to live.
</li>
<li>Ask yourself this: would your childhood self be proud of you, or embarrassed?
</li>
<li>Ralph Waldo Emerson said. “Do not go where the path may lead; go
instead where there is no path and leave a trail.”
</li>
<li>Nothing will actually happen if you stop being afraid. You're free.
</li>
<li>Everything that you are used to, done long enough, starts to
seem natural, even though it might not be.
</li>
<li><b>Train yourself to flinch forward, and your world changes radically.</b>
</li>
<li>Flinch forward in nature, at home, in your workplace, anywhere.
Try whatever you like or find interesting. Climb trees, eat new
food, or learn to dance. All are provocations to the status quo that
you use as stepping stones to larger explorations.
</li>
<li><b>Fact: those who face the flinch make a difference. The rest do
not.</b>
</li>
<li>Today, right now, eliminate all excuses from your vocabulary.
Refuse to mince words or actions. Refuse a scar-free life.
</li>
<li>Whatever you are used to, whether cigarettes, shopping, or
twitter, must be eliminated in the quest to get into the ring. You
must make a sacrifice on the altar of greatness and perform acts
that others will not.

<p>
If you aren't willing to sacrifice your comfort, you don't have what
it takes
</p>

<p>
Set fire to your old self. It's not need here. It's too busy
shopping, gossiping about others, and watching days go by and asking
why you haven't gotten as far as you'd like. This old self will die
and be forgotten by all but family, and replaced by someone who
makes a difference.
</p>
</li>

<li><b>Stop flinching. Speak up. Join us.</b>
</li>
<li>In contrast, there is only one way to do it right and to see the
truth. It is to look at these ways of acting in yourself or others
and cross through their verbal defenses, and not to believe them at
all.
</li>
<li>But the solution is always the same: ruthless yet compassionate
honesty in the face of all the lies you tell yourself.
</li>
<li>There are enough viewers. There are enough cheerleaders. There
are enough coaches and enough commentators. What there isn't enough
of are players.
</li>
<li><b>Don't ever be afraid again</b>
</li>
<li>If you think you can do it, or you think you can't do it, you
are right. –– Henry Ford
</li>
<li>My favorite movie of all times is The Matrix. I like the movie
not only for the amazing special effects and action scenes, but for
it's insight in human condition. I believe we live in the Matrix. I
believe the matrix is very real. We may not be the unconscious
batteries living in the delusion of the programs created by the
machines, but we live in the delusion of the rules and belief
systems created by our parents , teachers, colleagues, bosses, and
society designed to control us.
</li>
<li>My mission in my life is to listen to my own voice as much as
possible and follow my instincts.

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Challenge yourself by doing things that hurt, on purpose.
Have a willpower practice, such as very hard exercise,
meditation, endurance, or cold showers. Choose something that
makes your brain scream with how hard it is, and try to tolerate
it. The goal isn't just to get used to it. It's to understand
that pain is something you can survive.
</li>
<li>Remember things that are easy to forget. Upgrade your current
relationships. Create un-birthdays for your friends and stick to
them. Go through old text messages to rekindle dormant
friendships. It can be awkward, but that's the point. You will
make an impact by choosing to do what makes others nervous.
</li>
<li>Read more. Not just current blog posts and tweets and
Facebook updates online, but other sources that take more
consideration than blog posts or news. Find thorough and in-depth
analyses of subjects you find interesting, or irreverent stuff
that makes you feel alive. Read things you disagree with. Read
things that are too difficult to understand, and then overcome
your discomfort by pushing yourself to understand them.
</li>
<li>Get some scars by working with your hands. Try to understand
how things in your world work, like your car, your stereo system,
or even your kitchen. Have a garden or a dog to help you stay
grounded in the real world.
</li>
<li>Turn your mobile phone off for a few hours each day. Having
nothing to do while you're waiting for a bus can be boring, but
it's only when you're bored that the scary thoughts come to the
surface. Use a dumb phone on the weekends to prevent yourself
from checking your messages.
</li>
<li>Find new friends who make you feel uncomfortable, either
because they have done more than you or because they have done
nothing that you have. Meet tattoo artists or homeless people,
millionaires or best-selling authors. Host dinner parties for
them. Serve them bizarre food. Why the hell not?
</li>
<li>Renegotiate your work. If you achieve X, then will your
employer do Y? Ask beforehand and deliver, or if you can't get
permission, go for it anyway and ask for forgiveness. Create a
new job title for yourself; then carve out the job.
</li>
<li>Start dressing as if you had a very important job or meeting,
or as if you were twenty years old again and thought you were the
coolest person on Earth. What would you do differently? How would
people treat you once you did?
</li>
<li>Imagine that you have to leave a legacy, and everyone in the
world will see the work you've done. Volunteer. Create something
that lasts and that can exist outside of you, something that
makes people wonder and gasp. Build a support structure for
others. Devote some of your time or money to it.
</li>
<li>Make something amazing, something that's terrifying to you.
Stay uncomfortable. Fight the flinch wherever you see it. Leave
no stone un-turned.
</li>
