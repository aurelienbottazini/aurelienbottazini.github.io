The Miracle Morning: The Not-So-Obvious Secret Guaranteed to Transform Your Life (Before 8AM) — Hal Elrod
</p>

<p>
It begins with accepting total responsibility for every aspect of your
life and refusing to blame anyone else.
</p>

<p>
Personally, I used to struggle with this, because I am a bit of an
obsessive-compulsive perfectionist, and anal about keeping my things
looking clean and neat. Then I realized that I needed to get over it,
because the purpose of a book like this is not for it to remain
untouched, but rather to maximize the value we extract from it.
</p>

<p>
Now, I mark up all of my books so I can revisit them anytime and
quickly recapture all of the key benefits, without having to read the
entire book again.
</p>

<p>
The average American is 20 lbs. overweight, $10,000 in debt, slightly
depressed, dislikes his or her job, and has less than one close
friend.
</p>

<p>
“The biggest adventure you can ever take is to live the life of your dreams.”
</p>

<p>
You must first dedicate time each day to becoming the person you need to be.
</p>

<p>
How you wake up each day and your morning routine (or lack thereof)
dramatically affects your levels of success in every single area of
your life. Focused, productive, successful mornings generate focused,
productive, successful days—which inevitably create a successful
life—in the same way that unfocused, unproductive, and mediocre
mornings generate unfocused, unproductive, and mediocre days, and
ultimately a mediocre quality of life. By simply changing the way you
wake up in the morning, you can transform any area of your life,
faster than you ever thought possible.
</p>

<p>
You know how sometimes you hear something over and over again without
actually implementing it, but then one day it finally clicks for you?
</p>

<p>
Jim proclaim with certainty, “Your level of success, will rarely
exceed your level of personal development, because success is
something you attract by the person you become,”
</p>

<p>
Our outer world will always be a reflection of our inner world. Our
level of success is always going to parallel our level of personal
development. Until we dedicate time each day to developing ourselves
into the person we need to be to create the life we want, success is
always going to be a struggle to attain.
</p>

<p>
I had to commit to making personal development a priority in my daily life.
</p>

<p>
Every day you and I wake up, we face the same universal challenge: to
overcome mediocrity and live to our full potential.
</p>

<p>
Step #1: Acknowledge the 95% Reality Check
Step #2: Identify the Causes of Mediocrity
Step #3: Draw Your Line In the Sand
</p>

<p>
Accept the paradigm:  my past does not equal my future. Talk to
yourself in a way that inspires confidence that not only is anything
possible, but that you are capable and committed to making it so.
</p>

<p>
Become the person I need to be to create the success, freedom, and quality of life that I truly want.
</p>

<p>
Schedule some time this week to think about and articulate your life
purpose. Write it down where you’ll see it every day. In fact, you’ll
have time to do this during your Miracle Morning.
</p>

<p>
Every single thought, choice, and action is determining who we are
becoming, which will ultimately determine the quality of our lives.
</p>

<p>
Always remember that who you’re becoming is far more important than
what you’re doing, and yet it is what you’re doing that is determining
who you’re becoming.
</p>

<p>
Research has shown that we virtually become like the average of the
five people we spend the most time with. Who you spend your time with
may be the single most determining factor in the person you become and
in your quality of life. If you are surrounded with lazy, weak-minded,
excuse-making people, you’ll inevitably become like them. Spend time
with positive, successful achievers and inevitably their attitudes and
successful habits will reflect on you. You’ll become more and more
like them.
</p>

<p>
Our levels of success will rarely exceed our level of personal
development, because success is something we attract by who we become.
</p>

<p>
If you don’t make the commitment today to start becoming the person
you need to be to create the extraordinary life you really want, what
makes you think tomorrow—or next week, or next month, or next year—are
going to be any different?  They won’t. And that’s why you must draw
your line in the sand.
</p>

<p>
Your entire life changes the day that you decide you will no longer
accept mediocrity for yourself. When you realize that today is the
most important day of your life. When you decide that now matters more
than any other time because it is who you are becoming each day based
on the decisions that you are making and the actions that you are
taking that is determining who you are going to be for the rest of
your life.
</p>

<p>
When you delay waking up until you have to—meaning you wait until the
last possible moment to get out of bed and start your day—consider
that what you’re actually doing is resisting your life.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, when you wake up each day with passion and purpose,
you join the small percentage of high achievers who are living their
dreams.
</p>

<p>
Step #1: Set Your Intentions Before Bed
Step #2: Move Your Alarm Clock Across The Room
Step #3: Brush Your Teeth
Step #4: Drink a Full Glass of Water
Step #5: Get Dressed or Jump In the Shower

</p>

<p>
Visualization, also known as creative visualization or mental
rehearsal, refers to the practice of seeking to generate positive
results in your outer world by using your imagination to create mental
pictures of specific behaviors and outcomes occurring in your life.
</p>

<p>
Morning exercise should be a staple in your daily rituals.
</p>

<p>
“Start every morning off with a personal success ritual. That is the
most important key to success.”  Then he went on to talk about the
importance of morning exercise.
</p>

<p>
The fastest way to achieve everything you want is to model successful
people who have already achieved it.
</p>

<p>
Scribing is the final practice in the Life S.A.V.E.R.S. and is really
just another word for writing,
</p>

<p>
Accelerated Growth – Then, I began to tap into the highest point of
value I would gain from reviewing my journals. I pulled out a sheet of
blank paper, drew a line down the middle, and wrote two headings at
the top: Lessons Learned and New Commitments.
</p>

<p>
Gain Clarity – The process of writing something down forces us to
think through it enough to understand it. Journaling will give you
more clarity, allow you to brainstorm, and help you work through
problems.
Capture Ideas – Journaling helps you not only expand your
ideas, but also prevents you from losing the important ideas that you
may want to act on in the future.
Review Lessons – It enables you to review all of the lessons you’ve
learned.
Acknowledge Your Progress – It’s wonderful to go back and re-read your journal entries
from a year ago and see how much progress you’ve made. It’s one of the
most empowering, confidence-inspiring and enjoyable experiences. It
can’t really be duplicated any other way.

<p>
You don’t actually have to do The Miracle Morning in the morning.

Overcoming Procrastination:  Do the Worst, First
</p>

<p>
It’s important to mix things up and keep variety in your Miracle Morning.
</p>

<p>
The problem for most people is that they don’t realize that this
seemingly unbearable first 10 days is only “temporary.” Instead, they
think it’s the way the new habit feels, and will always feel, telling
themselves: If the new habit is this painful, forget it—it’s not
worth it.
