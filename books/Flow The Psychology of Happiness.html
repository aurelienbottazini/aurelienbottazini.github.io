Flow: The Psychology of Happiness
— Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi
</p>

<p>
<b>Happiness is not something that happens</b>. Happiness, in
fact, is a condition that must be prepared for, cultivated, and
defended privately by each person.
</p>

<p>
People who learn to control inner experience will be able to
determine the quality of their lives.
</p>

<p>
“Don’t aim at success—the more you aim at it and make it a target, the
more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be
pursued; it must ensue . . . as the unintended side-effect of one’s
personal dedication to a course greater than oneself.”
</p>

<p>
When we feel in control of our actions, masters of our own fate we
feel a sense of exhilaration, a deep sense of enjoyment that is long
cherished and that becomes a landmark in memory for what life should
be like.
</p>

<p>
The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is
stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something
difficult and worthwhile.
</p>

<p>
Only direct control of experience, the ability to derive
moment-by-moment enjoyment from everything we do, can overcome the
obstacles to fulfillment.
</p>

<p>
How we feel about ourselves, the joy we get from living, ultimately
depend directly on how the mind filters and interprets everyday
experiences.
</p>

<p>
The problem arises when people are so fixated on what they want to
achieve that they cease to derive pleasure from the present.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps their greatest strength is that they are in control of their
lives.
</p>

<p>
After each success it becomes clearer that money, power, status, and
possessions do not, by themselves, necessarily add one iota to the
quality of life.
</p>

<p>
A person has to learn to provide rewards to herself. She has to
develop the ability to find enjoyment and purpose regardless of
external circumstances.
</p>

<p>
The most important step in emancipating oneself from social controls
is the ability to find rewards in the events of each moment.
</p>

<p>
“If you are pained by external things, it is not they that disturb
you, but your own judgment of them. And it is in your power to wipe
out that judgment now.” — Marcus Aurelius
</p>

<p>
This ability to persevere despite obstacles and setbacks is the
quality people most admire in others; it is probably the most
important trait not only for succeeding in life, but for enjoying it
as well.
</p>

<p>
The information we allow into consciousness determines the content and
the quality of life.
</p>

<p>
Information enters consciousness either because we intend to focus
attention on it or as a result of attentional habits.
</p>

<p>
The mark of a person who is in control of consciousness is the ability
to focus attention at will, to be oblivious to distractions, to
concentrate for as long as it takes to achieve a goal, and not longer.
</p>

<p>
Pain, fear, rage, anxiety, or jealousy. All these varieties of
disorder force attention to be diverted to undesirable objects,
</p>

<p>
Optimal experience: When the information that keeps coming into
awareness is congruent with goals, psychic energy flows effortlessly.
</p>

<p>
Flow experience: They are situations in which attention can be freely
invested to achieve a person’s goals, because there is no disorder to
straighten out, no threat for the self to defend against.
</p>

<p>
The “battle” is not really against the self, but against the entropy
that brings disorder to consciousness. It is really a battle for the
self; it is a struggle for establishing control over attention.
</p>

<p>
After each episode of flow a person becomes more of a unique
individual, less predictable, possessed of rarer skills.
</p>

<p>
Liberate the psychic energy that otherwise would be wasted in boredom
or worry.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The first is to try making external conditions match our goals.
</li>
<li>The second is to change how we experience external conditions to make them
fit our goals better.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Pleasure is an important component of the quality of life, but by
itself it does not bring happiness.
</p>

<p>
Enjoyable events occur when a person has not only met some prior
expectation or satisfied a need or a desire but also gone beyond what
he or she has been programmed to do and achieved something unexpected,
perhaps something even unimagined before.
</p>

<p>
Flow:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>First, the experience usually occurs when we confront tasks we have a
</li>
</ul>
<p>
chance of completing.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Second, we must be able to concentrate on what
</li>
</ul>
<p>
we are doing.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Third and fourth, the concentration is usually possible because the task undertaken has clear goals and provides immediate
</li>
</ul>
<p>
feedback.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Fifth, one acts with a deep but effortless involvement that
</li>
</ul>
<p>
removes from awareness the worries and frustrations of everyday life.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Sixth, enjoyable experiences allow people to exercise a sense of
</li>
</ul>
<p>
control over their actions.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Seventh, concern for the self disappears, yet paradoxically the sense of self emerges stronger after the flow
</li>
</ul>
<p>
experience is over.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Finally, the sense of the duration of time is altered
</li>
</ul>


<p>
The overwhelming proportion of optimal experiences are reported to
occur within sequences of activities that are goal-directed and
bounded by rules—activities
</p>

<p>
<b>When beating the opponent takes precedence in the mind over performing
as well as possible, enjoyment tends to disappear.</b>
</p>

<p>
Enjoyment appears at the boundary between boredom and anxiety, when
the challenges are just balanced with the person’s capacity to act.
</p>

<p>
The most universal and distinctive features of optimal experience
takes place: people become so involved in what they are doing that the
activity becomes spontaneous, almost automatic; they stop being aware
of themselves as separate from the actions they are performing.
</p>

<p>
you don’t conquer anything except things in yourself.
</p>

<p>
One of the most frequently mentioned dimensions of the flow experience
is that, while it lasts, one is able to forget all the unpleasant
aspects of life.
</p>

<p>
Thus enjoyable activities that produce flow have a potentially
negative aspect: while they are capable of improving the quality of
existence by creating order in the mind, they can become addictive, at
which point the self becomes captive of a certain kind of order, and
is then unwilling to cope with the ambiguities of life.
</p>

<p>
This growth of the self occurs only if the interaction is an enjoyable
one, that is, if it offers nontrivial opportunities for action and
requires a constant perfection of skills.
</p>

<p>
Freedom from the tyranny of time does add to the exhilaration we feel
during a state of complete involvement.
</p>

<p>
The key element of an optimal experience is that it is an end in
itself.
</p>

<p>
The task is to learn how to enjoy everyday life without diminishing
other people’s chances to enjoy theirs.
</p>

<p>
Optimal experience: a sense that one’s skills are adequate to cope with the
challenges at hand, in a goal-directed, rule-hound action system that
provides clear clues as to how well one is performing. Concentration
is so intense that there is no attention left over to think about
anything irrelevant, or to worry about problems. Self-consciousness
disappears, and the sense of time becomes distorted. An activity that
produces such experiences is so gratifying that people are willing to
do it for its own sake, with little concern for what they will get out
of it, even when it is difficult, or dangerous.
</p>

<p>
At the individual level anomie corresponds to anxiety, while
alienation corresponds to boredom.
</p>

<p>
Subjects who reported flow frequently were very surprising: activation
decreased when they were concentrating. Instead of requiring more
effort, investment of attention actually seemed to decrease mental
effort.
</p>

<p>
The family context promoting optimal experience
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>clarity:
</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The teenagers feel that they know what their parents expect from
them—goals and feedback in the family interaction are unambiguous.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Centering:
</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Or the children’s perception that their parents are interested in
what they are doing in the present, in their concrete feelings and
experiences, rather than being preoccupied with whether they will be
getting into a good college or obtaining a well-paying job.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Choice
</li>
</ul>
<p>
  children feel that they have a variety of possibilities from which
to choose, including that of breaking parental rules—as long as they
are prepared to face the consequences.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Commitment:
</li>
</ul>
<p>
the trust that allows the child to feel comfortable enough to set
aside the shield of his defenses, and become unselfconsciously
involved in whatever he is interested in.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Challenge: or the parents’ dedication to provide increasingly complex
</li>
</ul>
<p>
opportunities for action to their children.
</p>

<p>
Every person, no matter how unfit he or she is, can rise a little
higher, go a little faster, and grow to be a little stronger. The joy
of surpassing the limits of the body is open to all.
</p>

<p>
What is important is the general principle: that sexuality, like any
other aspect of life, can be made enjoyable if we are willing to take
control of it, and cultivate it in the direction of greater
complexity.
</p>

<p>
<b>The ultimate control: yoga and the martial arts</b>
</p>

<p>
Of the great Eastern methods for training the body, one of the oldest
and most diffuse is the set of practices known as Hatha Yoga.
</p>

<p>
Some of the most exhilarating experiences we undergo are generated
inside the mind, triggered by information that challenges our ability
to think, rather than from the use of sensory skills.
</p>

<p>
Great thinkers have always been motivated by the enjoyment of thinking
rather than by the material rewards that could be gained by it.
</p>

<p>
Having a record of the past can make a great contribution to the
quality of life. It frees us from the tyranny of the present, and
makes it possible for consciousness to revisit former times.
</p>

<p>
<b>They simply did what they enjoyed doing.</b>
</p>

<p>
“Philosophy” used to mean “love of wisdom,” and people devoted their
lives to it for that reason.
</p>

<p>
Goals-ends relationship must always be kept clear: specialization is
for the sake of thinking better, and not an end in itself.
</p>

<p>
Many people give up on learning after they leave school because
thirteen or twenty years of extrinsically motivated education is still
a source of unpleasant memories.
</p>

<p>
“Work and love.” It is true that if one finds flow in work, and in
relations with other people, one is well on the way toward improving
the quality of life as a whole.
</p>

<p>
AUTOTELIC PERSONALITY: The ability to create flow experiences
even in the most barren environment.
</p>

<p>
These individuals transformed the jobs they had to do into complex
activities. They did this by recognizing opportunities for action
where others did not, by developing skills, by focusing on the
activity at hand, and allowing themselves to be lost in the
interaction so that their selves could emerge stronger afterward.
</p>

<p>
Improve the quality of life through work, two complementary strategies
are necessary. On the one hand jobs should be redesigned so that they
resemble as closely as possible flow activities. Recognize
opportunities for action, to hone their skills, to set reachable
goals.
</p>

<p>
When challenges and skills were both high they felt happier, more
cheerful, stronger, more active; they concentrated more; they felt
more creative and satisfied.
</p>

<p>
The results showed that people wished to be doing something else to a
much greater extent when working than when at leisure, and this
regardless of whether they were in flow.
</p>

<p>
When it comes to work, people do not heed the evidence of their
senses. They disregard the quality of immediate experience, and base
their motivation instead on the strongly rooted cultural stereotype of
what work is supposed to be like. They think of it as an imposition, a
constraint, an infringement of their freedom, and therefore something
to be avoided as much as possible.
</p>

<p>
Flow breaker:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The lack of variety and challenge.
</li>
<li>The second has to do with conflicts with other people on the job,
</li>
</ul>
<p>
especially bosses.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The third reason involves burnout: too much pressure, too much stress,
</li>
</ul>


<p>
<b>The flow experience that results from the use of skills leads to
growth; passive entertainment leads nowhere.</b>
</p>

<p>
“The future will belong not only to the
educated man, but to the man who is educated to use his leisure
wisely.” — C. K. Brightbill
</p>

<p>
Yet unless one learns to tolerate and even enjoy being alone, it is
very difficult to accomplish any task that requires undivided
concentration.
</p>

<p>
The same person can make the morning wonderful and the evening
miserable. Because we depend so much on the affection and approval of
others, we are extremely vulnerable to how we are treated by them.
</p>

<p>
Human relations are malleable, and if a person has the appropriate
skills their rules can be transformed.
</p>

<p>
“Whosoever is delighted in solitude,” goes the old saying that Francis
Bacon repeated, “is either a wild beast or a god.”
</p>

<p>
Cicero once wrote that to be completely free one must become a slave
to a set of laws. In other words, accepting limitations is liberating.
</p>

<p>
It is much easier for a person to try developing her potential if she
knows that no matter what happens, she has a safe emotional base in
the family.
</p>

<p>
Early emotional security may well be one of the conditions that helps
develop an autotelic personality in children. Without this, it is
difficult to let go of the self long enough to experience flow.
</p>

<p>
Later in life friendships rarely happen by chance: one must
cultivate them as assiduously as one must cultivate a job or a family.
</p>

<p>
Those who try to make life better for everyone without having learned
to control their own lives first usually end up making things worse
all around.
</p>

<p>
Subjective experience is not just one of the dimensions of life, it is
life itself.
</p>

<p>
Material conditions are secondary: they only affect us indirectly, by
way of experience. Flow, and even pleasure, on the other hand, benefit
the quality of life directly.
</p>

<p>
The relevant point to be made here is that a person who knows how to
find flow from life is able to enjoy even situations that seem to
allow only despair.
</p>

<p>
A major catastrophe can provide a new, more clear, and more urgent
goal: to overcome the challenges created by the defeat. If the second
road is taken, the tragedy is not necessarily a detriment to the
quality of life.
</p>


<p>
Person’s ability to cope with stress, it is useful to distinguish three different kinds of
resources:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The first is the external support available, and especially
</li>
</ul>
<p>
the network of social supports. A major illness, for instance, will be
mitigated to a certain extent if one has good insurance and a loving
family.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The second bulwark against stress includes a person’s
</li>
</ul>
<p>
psychological resources, such as intelligence, education, and relevant
personality factors. Moving to a new city and having to establish new
friendships will be more stressful to an introvert than to an
extrovert.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>And finally, the third type of resource refers to the
</li>
</ul>
<p>
coping strategies that a person uses to confront the stress.
</p>


<p>
Those who know how to transform a hopeless situation into a new flow
activity that can be controlled will be able to enjoy themselves, and
emerge stronger from the ordeal. There are three main steps that seem
to be involved in such transformations:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Unselfconscious self-assurance.

<p>
He feels a part of whatever goes on around him, and tries to do his
best within the system in which he must operate.
</p>
</li>

<li>Focusing attention on the world.

<p>
One continues to stay in touch with what is going on, new
possibilities are likely to emerge, which in turn might suggest new
responses, and one is less likely to be entirely cut off from the
stream of life.
</p>
</li>

<li>The discovery of new solutions.

<p>
The other is to focus on the entire situation, including oneself, to
discover whether alternative goals may not be more appropriate, and
thus different solutions possible.
</p>
</li>
</ol>


<p>
It is more satisfying to help another person than to beat him down
</p>

<p>
The “autotelic self” is one that easily translates potential threats
into enjoyable challenges, and therefore maintains its inner harmony.
</p>

<p>
A person who is never bored, seldom anxious, involved with what goes
on, and in flow most of the time may be said to have an autotelic
self. The term literally means “a self that has self-contained goals,”
and it reflects the idea that such an individual has relatively few
goals that do not originate from within the self.
</p>

<p>
The autotelic self transforms potentially entropic experience into
flow. Therefore the rules for developing such a self are simple, and
they derive directly from the flow model. Briefly, they can be
summarized as follows:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Setting goals.
</li>
<li>Becoming immersed in the activity.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Only when a person’s actions are appropriately matched with the
opportunities of the action system does he truly become involved.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Paying attention to what is happening.
Concentration leads to involvement, which can only be maintained
by constant inputs of attention.
</li>
<li>Learning to enjoy immediate experience.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Having an autotelic self implies the ability to sustain involvement.
Self-consciousness, which is the most common source of distraction, is
not a problem for such a person. Instead of worrying about how he is
doing, how he looks from the outside, he is wholeheartedly committed
to his goals.
</p>

<p>
What this involves is turning all life into a unified flow experience.
If a person sets out to achieve a difficult enough goal, from which
all other goals logically follow, and if he or she invests all energy
in developing skills to reach that goal, then actions and feelings
will be in harmony, and the separate parts of life will fit
together—and each activity will “make sense” in the present, as well
as in view of the past and of the future. In such a way, it is
possible to give meaning to one’s entire life.
</p>

<p>
People who find their lives meaningful usually have a goal that is
challenging enough to take up all their energies, a goal that can give
significance to their lives.
</p>

<p>
The meaning of life is meaning: whatever it is, wherever it comes
from, a unified purpose is what gives meaning to life.
</p>

<p>
is not enough to find a purpose that unifies one’s goals; one must
also carry through and meet its challenges.
</p>

<p>
What counts is not so much whether a person actually achieves what she
has set out to do; rather, it matters whether effort has been expended
to reach the goal, instead of being diffused or wasted.
</p>


<p>
The third and final way in which life acquires meaning is the result
of the previous two steps. When an important goal is pursued with
resolution, and all one’s varied activities fit together into a
unified flow experience, the result is that harmony is brought to
consciousness.
</p>


<p>
Probably the most satisfying way to unify life into an all-embracing
flow activity is through the idealistic mode:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>First, psychic energy is invested in the needs of the organism, and
</li>
</ul>
<p>
psychic order is equivalent to pleasure.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When this level is temporarily achieved, and the person can begin to
</li>
</ul>
<p>
invest attention in the goals of a community,
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The next movement of the dialectic brings attention back to the self:
</li>
</ul>
<p>
having achieved a sense of belonging to a larger human system, the
person now feels the challenge of discerning the limits of personal
potential.
</p>

<p>
From this point on the person is ready for the last shift in the
redirection of energy: having discovered what one can and, more
important, cannot do alone, the ultimate goal merges with a system
larger than the person—a cause, an idea, a transcendental entity.
</p>


<p>
Inner conflict is the result of competing claims on attention. Too
many desires, too many incompatible goals struggle to marshal psychic
energy toward their own ends. It follows that the only way to reduce
conflict is by sorting out the essential claims from those that are
not, and by arbitrating priorities among those that remain.
</p>


<p>
Was it worth sacrificing my health for the promotion? What happened to
those lovely children who have suddenly turned into sullen
adolescents? Now that I have achieved power and financial security,
what do I do with it? In other words, the goals that have sustained
action over a period turn out not to have enough power to give meaning
to the entirety of life. This is where the presumed advantage of a
contemplative life comes in. Detached reflection upon experience, a
realistic weighing of options and their consequences, have long been
held to be the best approach to a good life.
</p>

<p>
Activity and reflection should ideally complement and support each
other. Action by itself is blind, reflection impotent.
</p>
