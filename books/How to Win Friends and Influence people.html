A leader's job often includes changing your people's attitudes
and behavior. Some suggestions to accomplish this:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Begin with praise and honest appreciation.
</li>
<li>Call attention to people's mistakes indirectly
</li>
<li>Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person
</li>
<li>Ask questions instead of giving direct orders
</li>
<li>Let the other person save face
</li>
<li>Praise the slightest improvement and praise very improvement.
Be "hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise."
</li>
<li>Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to.
</li>
<li>Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct.
</li>
<li>Make the other person happy about doing the thing you
suggest.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Keep the following guidelines in mind when it is necessary to
change attitudes or behavior:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Be sincere. Do not promise anything that you cannot deliver.
Forget about the benefits to yourself and concentrate on the
benefits to the other person.
</li>
<li>Know exactly what it is you want the other person to do.
</li>
<li>Be empathetic. Ask yourself what it is the other person
really wants.
</li>
<li>Consider the benefits that person will receive from doing
what you suggest.
</li>
<li>Match those benefits to the other person's wants.
</li>
<li>When you make your request, put it in a form that will convey
to the other person the idea that he personally will benefit.
</li>
</ol>
