Unfortunately the company I am working for had to layoff 100 employees (10% of the workforce).
This had a lot of impact on the people still at the company.
How do you stay motivated when you don't agree with layoffs like that?

What's helping me is I don't want work, let alone the company board, to affect my mood.

I am also thinking about the principle of *Not acting like your wage*.
Always do your best and new opportunities will arise.

Finally I love [this video from professor Brian Harvey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMloyp6NI4E).
Human behavior is a matter of habit.
I will stay motivated.
I will keep doing great work.
I don't want to slow down and create bad habits.
