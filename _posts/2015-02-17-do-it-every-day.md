_Our time is limited. What we focus on defines us. Getting clear on
the goal gives us focus we have ourselves defined_

_Whatever you focus on, grows_

These were advice given to me by [Kuty](https://twitter.com/kuty).
Spend some time each day practicing until it becomes second nature.

New habits are not easy to form. Here are a few tips to get you
started:

+ One new habit at a time
+ At the beginning it will be fun. The real challenge come afterwards.
  Before you can start seeing the results, while this new habit is
  forming. After 66 days – based on studies — you've successfully formed a new habit.
+ Believe in the _growth mindset_. You brain is like a muscle. You can
  accomplish anything if you put enough effort into it.
+ Growth comes as a fight against your current comfort zone.
