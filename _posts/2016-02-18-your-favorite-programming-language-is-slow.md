My favorite scripting language is Ruby. And If we speak of execution speed it is
not the fastest language around.

Reccurently I see people worrying about this. Comparing their favorite language
to others, focusing on this _execution speed_.

*It does not matter*.

What matters is how much time you gain by using a particular programming language.

Here are some questions I like to ask myself:

- Is it convenient?
- Is it easy to use?
- Do you enjoy coding with it?
- Are you *fast* implementing new features?
- How much time does it take you to implement a prototype? (Weeks is a wrong answer)

You never know it a business idea is good before actually testing it. If your
idea is really good, people are going to beg you for using your software.

You can worry about scalability and speed of execution when you are successfull.
Before that it is just noise.

And anyway (from the [Mythical Man Month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month)): _When designing a new kind of system, a team will design a throw-away
system (whether it intends to or not). This system acts as a "pilot plant" that
reveals techniques that will subsequently cause a complete redesign of the
system._
