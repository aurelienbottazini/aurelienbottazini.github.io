I find myself hesitating again between clojure(script) and Ruby / Javascript.

- Ruby and Javascript are what I use at work.
- clojure is what I dream to use.

The benefits from clojure(script) that make me hesitate are

- a language and frameworks ahead of anything else I can find in the Ruby and Javascript world.
- stable librairies
- one language to do everything.

The benefit from Ruby and Javascript are

- my knowledge of the language and of the tools
- How it [synergize](./2023-07-16-synergize.md) with my job.
- One less layer of indirection (clojurescript compiles down to javascript)

I have examples of people switching away from clojurescript to remove that layer of indirection:

- [4x smaller, 50x faster Â· asciinema blog](https://blog.asciinema.org/post/smaller-faster/)
- [The umbrella project](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella) -> reimpleming and extending what has been done with [geom](https://github.com/thi-ng/geom)


I can find ways to *replicate* the stabilities of Clojure librairies by carefully handpicking JS librairies. I can stay ahead of the curve by applying clojure principles in the JS world. It is also way easier to do it as a solo developer. **BUT** it is impossible to remove that layer of indirection from clojure.

Do it need clojure to be successful? NO. Would clojure make my life easier? Possibly. As I committed myself to [synergize](./2023-07-16-synergize.md),
I am committing myself to Ruby and JS. I am hesitating too much and this hesitation prevents me from working on my projects.
