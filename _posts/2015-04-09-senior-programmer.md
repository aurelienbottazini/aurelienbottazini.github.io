I feel sad when I see job offers looking for a **Senior _your favorite
language here_ Programmer**.

I donâ€™t like the idea of being a Senior Programmer in a particular
language. You should know several different programming languages and you
should not be afraid to switch between languages. You should be eager
to learn new ones.

Knowing too much language specific tricks makes your code harder to
read. It is not worth it.

A Senior Programmer should:

* Choose the right tools for the job
* Lead effectively
* Understand the business needs
* Keep things simple and working
