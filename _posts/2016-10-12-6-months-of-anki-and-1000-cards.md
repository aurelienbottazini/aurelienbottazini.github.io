[Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) is a multi-platform—mac, windows, ios,
android, Linux—flash card program. The main advantage of using Anki is
that it supports spaced repetition. As I am constantly trying to
learn, I am also a champion at forgetting what I am learning. I have
been using Anki for about 6 months now to try to help me remember.

**I created more than 1000 cards and I am amazed by the results
on my memory.**

However, the results you get are highlight dependent on how you create
your cards. Engagement is also affected. I suspect two main reasons
people fail using Anki are:

- Bad flash cards.
- weak review habits

## How to create useful flashcards ##

First you should be able to create them at all times and you should
create them as soon as you have learned something new. Don't wait for
the end of the chapter or even worse the end of the book. It will only
make it painful for you to create all the flashcards as it will
take you a lot of time.

It simply means I have installed Anki on my phone and I use it to
create cards when I am on the move.

It is also really important to make your cards:

- **memorable:** don't hesitate to suggest yourself acronym you could use
  to help you remember. Take screenshots of the actual book or video
  you are watching. It will help activate your visual memory.
- **easy enough:** if they are too hard, you will resist reviewing.
  You want each card to activate as a trigger for your memory. It is
  OK if your card requires you do write some code, do draw something
  as practice is also important to memory. Make it easy to do and
  reasonably short.
- **clear:** As I wrote card I improved their clarity. At the
  beginning they were basic but I have now included some tools
  like
  [Skitch](https://evernote.com/skitch/),
  [Recordit](http://recordit.co/)
  and [Markers](https://www.stabilo.com). I don't hesitate to write on
  books I read.

Find what works for you and try to improve the clarity of your cards
as soon as you have difficulties remembering something.

Here are some examples from my deck.

I always use the same colors when I highlight. It helps me to quickly
scan answers and still find what's important on my screenshot.

## Your review environment should rock ##

I am a programmer so it was important for me to setup an enjoyable
environment where I could practice. I called my
environment
[training heaven](https://github.com/aurelienbottazini/training-heaven) and
it is available on [github](https://github.com/aurelienbottazini/training-heaven).

It is setup with automatic reloading and I preloaded all the
libraries I am using in my cards. The goal is to have a quick
starting point for all the questions I have in my decks.

## Your decks ##

At the beginning I created a lot of decks. This was a mistake. Another
learning trick is to connect your knowledge. If you can build _roads_
between different knowledge, they will stick more easily.

Nowadays I have few decks and I am using a lot of tags to classify my
cards. I changed the default display of cards to show tags at the top.
This way I can have questions on different subjects with one glance at
the tags on my card I know which subject I am studying.

## Review ##

To use Anki effectively, you must make the experience personal.
Customize your learning environment. Make it efficient and enjoyable
to use.

Use external tools to help you create interesting cards. Try to
connect different subjects together to make your new knowledge stick!

Create cards as soon as your learn something new. Don't wait too long
before creating cards. It is just too painful to create a lot of cards
at the end of a book or course.
