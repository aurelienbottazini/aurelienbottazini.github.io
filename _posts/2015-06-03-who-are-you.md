This is an exercise from a course I am taking on Udemy: "A course for
freelancers who want to move up" from the incredible _Seth Godin_.

## What do you want to do ##

I want to create. Create in the digital world because that's where I
feel I have the most freedom. I particularly love the description made
in the movie _Inception_ where Architect love to build inside dreams.
Everything is possible. That's how I feel when I create apps /
websites.

I like and need to touch everything. Art / UX / Business decisions /
Code. This is when I am good. This is when I am smart.

I want to combine smart technologies to create things people believed
impossible. I want to get the benefits of my work and I don't want to
wait. To be responsible for what I do and to be in charge.

## Who do you want to change, and how do you want to change them? ##

Before everything else I want to change myself and the way I live. I
like Tim Ferris' approach with the _4 hour work week_ as it push us
towards the essentialist way of life. But I like what I do. This is my
passion. I need variety but I don't want to be in a position when I
need to stop. I want to be somewhere where I don't want to stop.

I want to change people I interact with and show them the way to
success. My previous successes are a proof I know how to do it. I
need to capitalize on it and put it on another level.

## How much risk? How much are you willing to put at stake to make the change you seek ##

I willing to risk my current Job. I am not willing to risk the
relationship I have with my loved ones or my house

## How much work are you willing to do to get there? ##

Everything

## Does this project matter enough for the risk and the effort you're putting into it? ##

Yes

## Is it possible â€” has anyone with your resources ever pulled off anything like this? ##

Yes. There are plenty of success stories on being successful. On
the app store: _lescapadou_, with a SASS app: _37signals_
