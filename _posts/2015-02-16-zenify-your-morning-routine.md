Recently I have finished reading
[The Miracle Morning](http://www.amazon.com/The-Miracle-Morning-Not-So-Obvious-Guaranteed/dp/0979019710URL).
It is all about setting up a _morning routine_ to start you day the
right way. You can adapt your routine any way you want. Just do what
works for you.

Here is what I like to do:

+ Drink water and a nice tea (getting hydrated is ultra important).
+ Meditate for [8 minutes](http://www.8minutes.org/)
+ Review the 3 Most Important Tasks for the day. Keep them short. I
  consider my day successful as soon as they are done.
+ Stretching exercises.
+ Shower. While showering, I visualize what are my _big picture_
  objectives. What I really want to accomplish in my life. This help
  my focus on the right things. I find it helpful to think about it
  every day.

At the end of your routine you should feel calm, clear about your
objectives and confident that your day will be a successful one.
