Why do we use `call` as the default main method for ruby services?

```ruby
class MyService
  def self.call
    new.do_stuff
  end

  def do_stuff
   "doing some stuff"
  end
end

MyService.call                  # => "doing some stuff"
```

Why not `run`? or `main`?
Well, this is just a ruby convention. This is also enforced in the language at different places.

For example when you grab a method from any Object and try to call it by itself
```ruby
def foo
    "foo"
end

m = Object.new.method(:foo)
puts m.call
# >> foo
```

Another example, when you create a `proc` , one of the ways to use that `proc` is to `call` it.

```ruby
p  = proc { "foo" }
p.call                          # => "foo"
```
