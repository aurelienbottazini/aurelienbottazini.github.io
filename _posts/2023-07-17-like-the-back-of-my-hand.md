Why should you know things like the back of your hand?

After all, you can find everything you will ever want to know from a
quick search on internet. There's even ChatGPT now you ask it
everything and it does a fairly good job answering documentation
questions and more.

It comes down to two qualities you want to have:
Creativity[^2] and good habits[^1]

## Creativity

You want to master your field well enough so that you can think
creatively about it. If you always have to ask someone else (human or
robot) Â­what to d how are you supposed to come up with original ideas?

This is why as a programmer It's important for me to be able to recite
the GOF Design patterns[^3], the list of refactorings[^4] and so on.

## Habits

Lifelong Learning is an enabler. As you get smarter, you meet smarter
people and give yourself the opportunity to do more things.
It gives you more control over your life.
