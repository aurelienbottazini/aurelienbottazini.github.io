It is really easy to get caught up in the _flow_ of endless
information. Tweets, SMS, emails. It is also really to get so _busy_
that you forget whatâ€™s important.

Never forget to take some time to reflect on your actions. Ideally you
want to set up a specific time for that, at least once a week (I
prefer each day). Make it a habit.

Review your to-do list, you goals. Think about the big picture. What
do you want in your life? What do you want to achieve in 6 months, 1
year, 5 year a decade? Do you have a plan? Are you following it?

Whatever you focus on will improve. Sometimes fast, sometimes slowly
but you will get closer to your goal. However if you forget about your
objectives you will never reach them.

It is much more important to **focus on the right thing** than to be
busy doing meaningless work.
