I am always surprised by the number of people who refuse to read books. They
often seem proud of it. It is a big mistake.

Books are **shortcuts**. They are shortcuts toward:

* a better job
* smarter decisions
* a successful project
* peace of mind
* health
* …

The list is infinite. It just depends on what you choose read and how
you remember it. And It is easier than ever to make a choice. Find
someone you admire and check his website. He probably has a blog with
a list of suggestions. Or you can go on Amazon, choose a field of
interest, and pick one of the most popular book.

Some people think an alternative is just browsing and reading some
articles online. It can be a good complement but don’t see it as a
replacement.

You **should** read.
