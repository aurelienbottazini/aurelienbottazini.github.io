> From my great-grandfather: not to have attended schools for the public; to have had good teachers at home, and to realize that this is the sort of thing on which one should spend lavishly. ­Marcus Aurelius

Don't hesite to pay for great teachers.
While there's a lot of great free courses on the web. But the vast majority of the time, the best learning material is not free.

While it is not free, it is also not very expensive.

Some example:

- [Undertanding Javascript by Anthony Alicea](https://www.udemy.com/course/understand-javascript/?referralCode=7E5C6727F7959934C311) -> $19 sale as I write this article
- [Graceful Dev by Avdi Grimm](https://graceful.dev) -> $99 / year
- [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/) -> $390 / year
- [Javascript Allongé](https://leanpub.com/javascriptallongesix) -> $19.99

I could go on and on but those are so much better by 99% of the free material I see on youtube. Much better than blog posts from medium.com or dev.to. Why?

- The learning experience is more consistent with a singular resource.
- You learn from the best of the best in their respective field
- You learn from a resource that was designed exclusively for teaching you something. On the contrary free Blog posts on medium.com or dev.to often have a hidden objective of promoting either the writer or an idea.

We are in an era where you can learn for free. But you can also spend a little bit and learn from the best of the best.

Give yourself a shortcut toward excellence. Support the best teachers. Spend some dollars.
