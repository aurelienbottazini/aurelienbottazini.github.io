## What do people buy when they buy something from you? ##

They are buying someone that will define their problems, point them in
the right direction and give their idea a chance to be successful.
It includes Code expertise, Design and UX reviews. I don't judge but
focus on providing the best possible solution.

## What are you doing thatâ€™s difficult? ##

- Managing relationships.
- Being at the frontier between design / code / Business.
- Staying up to date to latest technologies
