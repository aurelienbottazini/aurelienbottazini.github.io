I like to start my day by defining three MIT – *M*ost *I*mportant
*T*asks.

In some cases the most important cases is the most difficult one.
That’s perfect! Don’t delay it, [don’t flinch](http://theflinch.com/),
that’s a trap.

If you don’t do it right away, it will be stuck in a corner of your
head. You will never be able to forget it and I can promise you it is
going to kill your productivity.

On the contrary, I you manage to focus on it. Spend the necessary time
to solve this problem, you will feel great afterwards.
